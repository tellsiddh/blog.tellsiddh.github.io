Welcome to my blog! I'm **Siddarth**, a software engineer who enjoys building things, learning in public, and occasionally writing about it all.

<!--more-->

This blog is a space where I’ll be sharing:

- 🧠 Thoughts on technology, software development, and engineering practices  
- ✍️ Tutorials and how to guides that I wish I had when I was learning something  
- 🧳 Personal experiences from my journey in tech (and life!)  
- 💡 Ideas, experiments, and the occasional hot take  

### Why Jekyll?

I chose [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) with the [Minimal Mistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) theme because it gives me control, speed, and a clean writing experience. Plus, I get to tinker under the hood, which, let’s be honest, is half the fun!

### What’s Next?

Expect a mix of deep dives into topics I’m exploring, personal reflections, and maybe even some side project breakdowns. I’m excited to keep learning and growing, and hope you'll join me on the ride.

If you’re reading this, thanks for being here 🙌

Stay curious,  
**Siddarth**
