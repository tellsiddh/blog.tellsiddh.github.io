Not everyone starts their tech journey from a programming language and not everyone is a programming prodigy. I certainly was neither of those.

## The beginning

My tech journey started when I was 15 years old. I saw a bluetooth controlled toy car on youtube and found myself looking at some DIY channels. At that point, I had no idea what an arduino was, how to write a program or how any of the elctrical components worked let alone how bluetooth worked. This was the first time I was asking my parents for money to buy some parts, so I had to analyze the video in detail and look at all the comments to make sure I was not being scammed. With the video imprinted in my brain, I set out with a list of parts in my hand to the nearest electronic store I could find on google maps.

My nervousness was evident when I could not even pronounce or explain half the parts I wanted. A lot of people came in and left with the things they wanted in mere minutes. I spent 30 minutes browsing, asking questions and gathering my stuff. With everything in my bag, I left the shop and went home.

## This was tough

I thought I had completed half my journey - 1. I had studied the video in depth to make sure it will work before I even bought anything, 2. I had all the components, 3. Now all that is left is to assemble and play with my new expensive toy car. Or that's what I thought. I started on a Satuarday evening, carefully assembled the parts on a chassis I had bought.
